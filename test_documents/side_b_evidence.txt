RE: Dispute regarding ABC Construction Ltd. contract performance

DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED:

1. KITCHEN REMODELING:
- Cabinets are misaligned and doors don't close properly
- Countertop has visible seams and uneven finish
- Plumbing leaks detected under sink (3 instances)
- Electrical outlets not properly grounded (safety hazard)

2. BATHROOM FIXTURES:
- Shower door doesn't seal properly, causing water leakage
- Toilet installation is unstable
- Tiles are cracked in multiple locations
- Ventilation fan is not functioning

3. EXTERIOR PAINTING:
- Paint is already peeling in several areas
- Improper surface preparation evident
- Color does not match the approved sample
- Window frames were not properly masked

4. ROOF REPAIR:
- Waterproofing failed - we have experienced leaks during recent rain
- Missing shingles in northwest corner
- Flashing around chimney is improperly installed

EXPERT INSPECTION REPORTS:

We have engaged three independent certified inspectors who reviewed the work:

1. BuildSafe Inspections Inc. - Found 23 code violations
2. Quality Home Review LLC - Rated work quality as "below industry standard"
3. Professional Construction Audit - Estimated $18,000 in corrective work needed

PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE:
We have 47 photographs documenting the deficiencies, timestamped and geo-tagged.

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
- Estimated repair costs: $18,000
- Temporary housing during repairs: $3,000
- Lost rental income: $5,000
- Total damages: $26,000

The contract clearly states "$50,000 for services rendered" with professional quality standards. This work does not meet that standard.

We are willing to pay for acceptable work, but request either:
A) Party A corrects all deficiencies at no additional cost, OR
B) Payment of only the portion representing acceptable work ($32,000), withholding $18,000 for corrective repairs

Party A has refused to acknowledge these issues or provide any remedy.
