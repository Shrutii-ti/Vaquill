PROSECUTION'S POSITION:
The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that defendant James Martinez committed armed robbery with clear intent, threatened the victim with a deadly weapon, and caused lasting psychological harm. The combination of eyewitness identification, video evidence, physical evidence, and defendant's own contradictory statements proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

SENTENCING RECOMMENDATION:
Given the violent nature of the crime, use of a weapon, victim trauma, and defendant's criminal history, the prosecution seeks the maximum sentence of 9 years in state prison plus restitution to the victim.

Respectfully submitted,
District Attorney Sarah Williams
Criminal Division, Superior Court of California
